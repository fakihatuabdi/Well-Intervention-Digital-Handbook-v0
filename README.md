# Well Intervention Digital Handbook v0

A comprehensive digital handbook application for oil and gas professionals, featuring interactive content on Rig Hub, Well Intervention, and other industry-specific resources.

## Features

- 📱 Progressive Web App (PWA) - Works on mobile like a native app
- 📚 Comprehensive Handbook with multiple modules
- 🔍 Search functionality
- 📊 Calculator tools
- 💬 AI Chatbot integration
- 🔖 Bookmarks for saving articles
- 📱 Fully responsive design

## Self-host & always-on

- Container image: GitHub Actions builds and pushes `ghcr.io/<owner>/well-intervention-digital-handbook:latest` on every push to `main` (see [.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml](.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml)).
- Quick run locally or on server: `docker compose up -d` (uses [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml), serves on port 3000 by default, auto-restarts).
- Update to latest build: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` to sync with the newest image; no manual `npm start` needed.
- Build manually if desired: `docker build -t ghcr.io/<owner>/well-intervention-digital-handbook:dev .` then run with `docker run -p 3000:80 ...`.
- SPA routing handled by Nginx config in [deploy/nginx.conf](deploy/nginx.conf); cache headers tuned for fast updates while keeping assets cached.

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

This project was bootstrapped for you with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

We've already run this for you in the `Codespaces: server` terminal window below. If you need to stop the server for any reason you can just run `npm start` again to bring it back online.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in the built-in Simple Browser (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P > Simple Browser: Show`) to view your running application.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
